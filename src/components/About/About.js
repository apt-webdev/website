                        I am in my senior year of the Master's degree in network and information systems engineering.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I am very proud of my journey, and I believe that the best is yet to come. 
                        My ambitions are to grow as a front-end developer and raise my standards for new challenges; 
                        Learn more about user interface designs and new programming technologies to set up web applications to a new level of usability.

                        But there is more, I like to be part of the community around me and actively contribute to it.
                        So, I love to connect to people and make new friends. I am also enthusiastic with sports, like basketball and soccer. 
                        Finally, I love to travel, read books, see old films, go out with friends and visit art galleries.
